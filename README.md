# VBA-challenge
The VBA script is provided in the text file and can be applied to the Multiple_year_stock_data Excel workbook given in class. The Excel file was too large to upload to GitHub.

There is a screenshot of the results for each worksheet in that workbook. 

I constructed the code based off the example/pseudo text Bill gave during class as well as examples from class activities. My other sources are as listed:
  
  To find the greatest total volume and percent increase: https://www.statology.org/vba-find-max-value-in-range/
  
  To find the greatest percent decrease: https://www.statology.org/vba-find-minimum-value-in-range/
  
  To find their corresponding tickers: https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vba-index-match/

I used the examples shown in these tutorials to create that part of my code.
